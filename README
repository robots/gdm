!!! WARNING !!!

This project started as curiosity why can I turn on this cheap 5500 station that i bought on internet. Lead to spending 4-5 months disassembling multiple firmwares from multiple stations. This all is work in progress, still evolving, still improving.

Tools available now:

docu - contains various documentation for Geodimeter totalstations 400/500/4000/600
gdm600 - tools for geodimeter 600
gdm-iface - interface to communicate with 400/500/4000 series of stations
