This is a detailed disassembly of a 608S. The unit arrived and was unresponsive to any power input.

## Servo Side
Removal of the servo side cover. This is the right hand side when looking at the control panel. Take care to not break off the keys on the red connectors, they are quite delicate. Some connectors are the same but the lengths and routing should make it clear what goes where.

Disconnecting the wiring and removing the fasteners holding the main board to the rest of the servo panel lets us get a look at both boards.

The failure to turn on is immediately apparent in the form of an exploded capacitor. Several caps were shorted or exploded through this unit.

With the cover out of the way, we can see the servo units and clean/grease points.

## Radio Side
Moving to the left side of the unit we can remove the cover and expose the vertical angle sensor and angle sensor boards. On a unit with a radio, this cover would include the radio. The radio would be wired to the empty white conenctor visible at the bottom of the sensor board?

The IDs of the sensors are on labels stuck to the bottom of this cavity. The horizonal sensor also has a label directly on it, much deeper in the unit.

## Angle Sensors
A better look at the angle boards after removal. These boards handle both angle sensors and the inclinometer. Note that theres a white and brown wire that need to be desoldered to completely remove the boards.

Digging deeper the internals of the angle sensors are visible when disassembling the horizonal sensor. Note that there is nothing really indexing the parts of this sensor together rotationally. Unknown if this is because it doesn't matter or because the unit would be re-calibrated. Suggest leaving the angle sensors completely assembled!

The sensor appears to be a 8 pole resolver with a coarse optical encoder for absolute positioning.

## Control Unit Base
The plate that the control unit attaches to has a very simple interconnect board. There's an unused connector here that might attach to the radio module, if equipped?

## Tribrach Mount
There's nothing aligning this with the rest of the unit rotationally besides the bolts. This may not matter as horizonal measurements are relative ones?

## Compensator
Looking back up inside the unit is the compensator with an interface board with not much interesting on it.

## Battery Mount
The battery mount has a simple board that includes the green LED you see through the optics. When looking at this first image or in to the battery cavity, + is the left contact, - is the right.

## EDM
The board here is attached to the large aluminum box and that whole assembly is held in with just the black snap clip on the side. It is possible to remove the board and aluminum box if you carefully remove the black fiber optic lines from the guide clip. Unknown if they can be removed from the actual sensor on the board without damage.
